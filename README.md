# LLM-based-AI-Assistant
The "Cosmic Navigator: AI Assistant for Satellites and Astronomy" is an LLM-based assistant designed to provide users with information and insights about space and astronomical objects. This assistant aims to go beyond the capabilities of a general-purpose LLM like ChatGPT by incorporating specialized knowledge and tools. The primary goal is to create an engaging and informative experience for users interested in exploring the cosmos.

The assistant is designed with the persona of a knowledgeable guide, drawing inspiration from Carl Sagan's ability to communicate complex scientific concepts with clarity and enthusiasm. It can answer questions about planets, exoplanets, and satellites, and perform basic calculations.

Additional data sources are used to enhance the assistant's knowledge base. The assistant uses a combination of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling to provide comprehensive and accurate information.
